My name is Karina Utyuzh, and I am a sophomore double-majoring in Accounting & Finance, and minoring in Business Analytics. I am the President and Founder of FCG. I am hoping to close the deprived consulting gap here at our wonderful university.

Helping spearhead FCG has been one of the greatest ventures she has undertaken as it has helped lead to cultivating new connections with those who share a similar passion and new friendships with her wonderful team. She knows with a positive mindset, high ambition and solid grit that she can help lead FCG to make considerable strides in the Chicagoland area and evolve into its fullest potential.\n                </p>\n              </Col>\n              <Col>\n                <Image photoToUse={\"safia_ghouse_headshot\"}/>\n              </Col>\n            </Row>\n            <h2 className=\"text-center\">\n              Director of External Communications\n            </h2>\n            <Row>\n              <Col>\n                <Image photoToUse={\"christopher_campagna_headshot\"}/>\n              </Col>\n              <Col>\n                <h3>\n                  Christopher Campagna\n                </h3>\n                <p>\n                  I am an incoming senior Accounting and Management Information Systems double major working towards a career in management/strategy consulting. Relationship building is something that I take pride in and enjoy. A business is only as strong as the people-the relationships-that support it. Collaborating in a dynamic group setting is where I find that I am the most creative and able to produce my best work. This summer, I will be working with PwC at their Chicago office as a START intern, conducting a variety of rotations within their Internal Firm Services department. I am excited to bring back all of the gained knowledge and experience to FCG. Outside of my professional life, I am a practitioner of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, finding the study of martial arts fascinating. I have also been skydiving twice, with plans to return to complete my “A” license.\n                </p>\n              </Col>\n            </Row>\n            <h1 className=\"text-center\">\n              Project Management Team\n            </h1>\n            <h2 className=\"text-center\">\n              Chief Operating Officer\n            </h2>\n            <Row>\n              <Col>\n                <h3>\n                  Deekshita Jaligama\n                </h3>\n                <p>\n                  Deekshitha is a sophomore majoring in Finance who is the Chief Operating Officer of Flames Consulting Group and is serving as the treasurer for The Accounting Club. The feeling of belongingness and the ability of these amazing organizations to give back to the community is something that she thoroughly enjoys being a part of. Having grown up in India, it was a rocky journey to move and adapt to everything in the U.S but she strongly believes that stepping out of that comfort zone constantly motivates her to become the best version of herself. She has learned to become comfortable with being uncomfortable. And, her mantra to success is all about being persistent and genuine. When she’s not in the work mode, she can be found either singing or practicing her favorite Indian Classical Dance form – Kuchipudi.\n                </p>\n              </Col>\n              <Col>\n                <Image photoToUse={\"deekshita_jaligama_headshot\"}/>\n              </Col>\n            </Row>\n            <h2 className=\"text-center\">\n              Project Managers\n            </h2>\n            <Row>\n              <Col>\n                <Image photoToUse={\"david_robinson_headshot\"}/>\n              </Col>\n              <Col>\n                <h3>\n                  David Robinson\n                </h3>\n                <p>\n                  Along with Flames Consulting Group, David interned at Flagstar Bank last summer and is involved in other on-campus organizations such as the Black Tech Scholars, Alpha Kappa Psi Business Professional Organization, and Business Scholars.
