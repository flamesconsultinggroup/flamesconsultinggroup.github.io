This summer, I will be working with PwC at their Chicago office as a START intern, conducting a variety of rotations within their Internal Firm Services department. I am excited to bring back all of the gained knowledge and experience to FCG. Outside of my professional life, I am a practitioner of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, finding the study of martial arts fascinating.
