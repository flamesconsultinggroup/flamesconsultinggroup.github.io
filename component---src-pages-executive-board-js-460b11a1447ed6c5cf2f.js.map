Relationship building is something that I take pride in and enjoy. A business is only as strong as the people-the relationships-that support it. Collaborating in a dynamic group setting is where I find that I am the most creative and able to produce my best work. This summer, I will be working with PwC at their Chicago office as a START intern, conducting a variety of rotations within their Internal Firm Services department. I am excited to bring back all of the gained knowledge and experience to FCG. Outside of my professional life, I am a practitioner of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, finding the study of martial arts fascinating. I have also been skydiving twice, with plans to return to complete my “A” license.\n                </p>\n              </Col>\n            </Row>\n          </Container>\n        </div>\n\n      </Layout>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Executive_Board;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
